# Hello world! :smiley:

we all start with a `Hello world` so here's one with flask

## To start a running server (on linux)
- type `export FLASK_APP = app`
- type `export FLASK_ENV = development`
- finally type `Flask run`

## To start a running server (on windows)
- type `FLASK_APP = app`
- type `FLASK_ENV = development`
- finally type `flask run`

Then you will see the following output 
```
$ flask run
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Restarting with watchdog (windowsapi)
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 121-244-654
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
